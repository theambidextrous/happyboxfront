              <p>HappyBox issues gift vouchers to its customers via its website. Each voucher is an opportunity to suggest an appropriate set of experiences for the recipient of the voucher. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the descriptions and pictures contained within the website and on the gift vouchers are a true reflection of the events in respect of which the voucher may be redeemed, these do not form part of a contract. If on contacting the Partner to redeem your voucher you feel that the activity taking place no longer accurately represents the activity shown on the HappyBox website or the gift vouchers, please contact the Customer Service and share this concern with our teams. Once a specific date has been booked, you will automatically become bound by the terms and conditions that individual Partner may have. Please note that experiences are subject to change without notice. This does not affect your statutory rights.</p>
             
              <div class="terms_li">
                  <h5>1. Prices</h5>
                  <p>
                 The prices of specific experiences against which gift vouchers can be redeemed which are displayed on our website are correct to the best of our knowledge and maintained on a daily basis. In the event of a voucher being issued at or redeemed against an accidental incorrect price, we will endeavour to inform the purchaser of the error within seven days of the voucher purchase / voucher redemption being made, we will allow the recipient to either obtain a full refund against the voucher or choose to pay the additional difference in price. Promotional discount codes can only be redeemed against certain HappyBox experiences.     
                  </p>

               <div class="terms_li">
                  <h5>2. Availability</h5>
                  <p>
                HappyBox sells vouchers which are valid for 6 months from the date of issue (unless otherwise stated) and each recipient is free to book their preferred date for their chosen experience. The experiences in respect of which vouchers may be redeemed are subject to availability and in some cases, subject to weather conditions on the day. In order to avoid disappointment, we recommend that you book the experience in respect of which the voucher will be redeemed well in advance and DO NOT organise travel or accommodation until the booking has been confirmed by the Partner. </p>
              </div>
               <div class="terms_li">
                  <h5>3. Booking</h5>
                  <p>
                Please do not arrive at a venue expecting to redeem your gift voucher without first making a booking with the Partner. HappyBox will not be held liable for any costs incurred if you do not follow the procedure set out in these Terms and Conditions and in your voucher pack.</p>
              </div>
               <div class="terms_li">
                  <h5>4. Event Duration</h5>
                  <p>
                      Details of event duration given on the website or the gift voucher are to be used as a guide only. Most events will be ‘open’ days, meaning that other members of the public will be taking part too. This could mean taking your turn with other members of the public. The information on our website and voucher is meant as an indication of what to expect at the session in respect of which your voucher is redeemed. As HappyBox vouchers can be redeemed in return for multi-location experiences, session lengths, agendas, vehicles used, numbers of participants and other factors specific to that experience may vary from location to location. Delays, curtailments and breakdowns are not within our control and therefore we cannot be held liable.
             </p>

               <div class="terms_li">
                  <h5>5. Safety</h5>
                  <p>
               The undertaking of these activities may involve some personal risk. With some events you may be required to sign a disclaimer on the day, please read these documents carefully. Some personal insurance policies may not cover some of the experiences in respect of which our vouchers may be redeemed. Please check with the Partner and your insurer well in advance of your day. Note that Partners usually require participants to comply with specified safety procedures. Please listen and take note if they ask you to do something - it is usually for your own safety.</p>
              </div>
               <div class="terms_li">
                  <h5>6. Validity</h5>
                  <p>
Each gift voucher is valid for a maximum of six months from the date of purchase unless otherwise stated. A voucher will be deemed to be invalid if it is out of date (the validity date is clearly stated on the HappyBox website once the user has registered his Box). Vouchers can only be extended if they are still inside their expiry date, if they have not been previously used, and if the experience is still available from the supplier. If the customer or recipient is unable to utilise the voucher before the expiry date then the voucher can be extended for standard admin fee of Kes2 000 by contacting the HappyBox Customer Service. If the activity in respect of which the voucher is to be redeemed has increased in price, the customer will also need to pay the difference in price. Vouchers purchased on Special Offer may not be extendable (in these instances this will have been clearly stated at the time of purchase). All experiences should be booked and taken before the expiry date available on the HappyBox website.  </p>
              </div>
               <div class="terms_li">
                  <h5> 7. Choosing the right experience</h5>
                  <p>
Many of the vouchers offered may be redeemed for experiences which have some type of restriction applied to them; these restrictions are not decided by us but by the individual Partner. These restrictions could include age, health, physical and size restrictions. Please read all the information provided for each experience, to ensure that your initial suggested voucher is the right one for the recipient. If you are unsure of the suitability of a particular event, please contact the HappyBox Customer Service Team with your query and we will advise you accordingly.  </p>

               <div class="terms_li">
                  <h5>8. Complaints</h5>
                  <p>
     The easiest way to resolve any problems that you may experience is to speak to the Partner on the day. They will ensure that any issues are rectified. If you are still not satisfied, please send in details of your complaint (including your voucher reference number and the name of the person you spoke to on the day) to: Customer Services, customerservices@happybox.ke , alternatively, you can contact our customer service by phone: +254 xxx. Please remember that the Partner will have the opportunity to respond as well. Similarly, we would like to hear any positive feedback. Email us on customerservices@happybox.ke            The prices of specific experiences against which gift vouchers can be redeemed which are displayed on our website are correct to the best of our knowledge and maintained on a daily basis.
